I liaise daily with various BUs, assisting them with payment matters and guiding them through finance-related processes and any queries they may have.\n\nI also complete journal entries, moving them from our internal system into relevant accounting systems, including reclassifying payments into correct cost centers.\n\nBeing part of the CGS International family, I have learnt that it is important to be kind to everyone you meet. You will never know when you might need their advice and help! I especially am thankful for many colleagues-turned-friends that I have met in my career journey here; they are especially helpful and make working life enjoyable. I also know that I have the support of great bosses that will aid in my career growth progression here.\n",

As the name of my department suggests, we are the frontliners when it comes to customer liaison. Daily, we have various clients calling in, emailing, and messaging us to enquire on our financial products, investment solutions or any technical queries they may have about the iTrade platform. \n\nIn general, I oversee and ensure that all queries received are being answered correctly and replied within the stipulated KPI. As a Manager, I strive to improve the overall Customer Experience with my team, to reach \u201CGold Standards\u201D through system enhancements and attending service-improvement trainings.\n\nIn addition, I am also involved with various projects, and this has greatly upgraded my skillsets. I am glad that the peers around me are willing to share their experience and give guidance, imparting their knowledge to me so that I can be an all-rounder.\n\nI enjoy working here as I get to experience the warmth of my fellow colleagues and am given continuous chances to improve and upskill myself!\n",
